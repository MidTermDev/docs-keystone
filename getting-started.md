## Step 4: Choose a Job

Jobs are how you earn $KEY. Open the jobs menu:

```

A GUI will open showing available jobs. Click one to see details, then click again to join.

**Recommended first jobs:**

| Job | Best For | Easy Money From |
|-----|----------|-----------------|

You can have up to **3 jobs** at once.

## Step 5: Pick a World

Walk to a portal based on your playstyle:

### Resource World (North - Cyan)
- Go here to **mine and gather**
- World resets periodically (your items stay)
- Best for: Miner job, getting materials

### Survival World (East - Green)
- Go here to **build a base**
- Permanent world, your builds stay forever
- Best for: Building, farming, peaceful play

### PVP World (South - Red)
- Go here for **factions and raiding**
- Full PVP enabled, can lose items
- Best for: Raider job, competitive players

## Step 6: Start Earning

Once you have a job and you're in a world, just play normally:

- **Miner**: Break stone and ores
- **Hunter**: Kill mobs
- **Farmer**: Harvest crops
- **Woodcutter**: Chop trees

You'll see payment notifications as you earn $KEY.

## Step 7: Check Your Balance

```

or just:

```
/bal
```

This shows your current $KEY balance.

## Step 8: Set a Home

Found a nice spot? Set your home:

```
/sethome
```

Return anytime with:

```
/home
```

## Step 9: Return to Spawn
