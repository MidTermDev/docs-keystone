# Introduction

## What is Keystone?

Keystone is a Minecraft survival server with a real cryptocurrency economy. When you play on Keystone, you earn **$KEY** - a token on the Solana blockchain that has real-world value.

This isn't a gimmick or a temporary play-to-earn scheme. We've built a sustainable economy where your time and effort translate into actual earnings.

## How It Works

```
Play Minecraft → Earn $KEY → Withdraw to Wallet → Trade on Solana
```

1. **Play normally** - Mine, farm, hunt, build, or fight
2. **Earn $KEY** - Your job pays you for activities
3. **Withdraw anytime** - Send $KEY to your Solana wallet
4. **Real value** - Trade $KEY on decentralized exchanges

## What Makes Us Different

### Sustainable Economy
We don't print infinite money. There are hourly earning caps, anti-exploit measures, and carefully balanced payouts. This keeps $KEY valuable.

### Multiple Playstyles
- **Builders** - Peaceful survival world
- **Grinders** - Resource world for mining
- **Fighters** - Factions PVP world with raiding
- **Traders** - Player-run market economy

### No Pay-to-Win
You can't buy $KEY to get ahead. Everyone earns through gameplay. The only way to get $KEY is to play.

## The $KEY Token

$KEY is a Solana SPL token. Key facts:

- **Blockchain**: Solana
